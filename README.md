# OpenGL Graphics Application

A custom graphics application developed in C++ using OpenGL, showcasing a wide range of rendering and game development techniques. 
This project features both 2D and 3D shape rendering, textured materials, real-time lighting, and billboarded sprites. 
Built from scratch, it includes systems for collision detection, camera control using quaternions, and dynamic scene interaction. 
The application also implements text rendering, enabling on-screen UI and debugging information.

## âœ¨ Features

- **2D & 3D Shape Rendering**  
  Renders basic primitives and custom meshes with support for both perspective and orthographic projections.

- **Textured Materials**  
  Applies textures to objects using UV mapping, with support for tiling, scaling, and filtering.

- **Real-Time Lighting**  
  Includes ambient, directional, and point lights using a basic Phong shading model.

- **Billboarding**  
  Supports camera-facing sprites, ideal for particles, icons, or UI elements in 3D space.

- **Collision Detection**  
  Basic collision systems for interactive and physics-aware objects.

- **Quaternion-Based Rotation**  
  Smooth and accurate rotation handling for objects and cameras, avoiding gimbal lock.

- **Text Rendering**  
  Displays real-time in-game text font rendering.

- **Transform System**  
  Hierarchical transformations with position, rotation, and scale for every object in the scene.

- **Manual OpenGL Pipeline**  
  Full control over VAOs, VBOs, shaders, and draw calls using modern OpenGL practices.

- **Graphics Sandbox Environment**  
  Flexible and extensible environment for experimenting with real-time rendering and interaction systems.

  - **Scene System**  
  Flexible and extensible scene system.

- **Tools:** Visual Studio  


## ðŸ§  What I Learned
This project greatly expanded my understanding of real-time rendering, transformation systems, and interactive graphics programming. 
Building core systems like lighting, text rendering, and collision detection from the ground up in OpenGL gave me valuable experience with low-level graphics APIs and mathematical foundations. 
It also strengthened my ability to design scalable, engine-like architecture suitable for both 2D and 3D applications.

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements

- Implement dynamic shadow mapping for realistic lighting depth and occlusion  
- Add skeletal animation support for animated 3D characters and objects  
- Integrate a real-time editor UI for spawning lights, adjusting materials, and scene debugging
